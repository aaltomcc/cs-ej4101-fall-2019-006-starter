# About Peizhe HOU
Hello! This is Peizhe Hou's website. I'm an exit-year EIT Digital Master student majoring in Human-computer Interaction and Design (Technical University of Madrid + Aalto University) and I have keen interests on user experience, user-centered design, and interactive process between human and computer.

Talking about myself, I had strong Industrial Design background gained from my bachelor’s study. I’ve also learned to develop different kinds of applications and interfaces. So, I am familiar with both design process and different programming languages and skills.

For my working experience, last year, I have been a research intern at Ontology Lab in Technical University of Madrid. I evaluated the user experience, especially the usability and accessibility of web application and optimized its interaction methods and interface.
